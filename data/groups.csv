<p>But what exactly is it?</p>
<p>To mark one year since our launch as the national centre for data science, we talked to some of the social scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, engineers, and industry and government thinkers who are driving this new area of research in The Alan Turing Institute about what data science means to them – and the role of the Institute in pioneering this new science.</p>

<p>Having been in trading for more than seven years, I realize just how hard it can be to find systems and indicators that work. I understand how expensive the research required to keep up with the ever-changing market can be. I also know how difficult it is to learn programming, and how costly using programmers to test your ideas can be. That being said, we want to build a rich environment for research; so members can find the most successful programming methodologies, and produce original ideas. Unlike the one-trick-wonders who claim to have all of the answers, and charge enormous amount of money for people to use faulty systems year after year with an insufficient portfolio of results, we separate ourselves from the competition with a proven track record of success.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For All Ages and Skill Levels</p>
<p>We accommodate all skill levels, regardless of prior experience with programming. We merely ask that you contribute by doing research,and/or providing us with your honest opinion. So instead of spending thousands of pounds a year on empty promises, our aim is to create a community where people can come together, and be provided with material to do research and share new ideas. As it stands now, only Quants are able to use the algorithms they make. We would like to give everyone access; regardless of educational level.</p>
<p>Learning Materials</p>
<p>Members will have access to a huge library of trading material: Books, videos, programming scripts, and the latest software. Material will be updated every month making sure members have access to the most up-todate information.</p>
<br>
<p>Cutting out programming cost and time</p>
<p>Enjoy the benefits of your programming abilities, which will give you a great edge as a trader. Programming allows you to try out new ideas and be spontaneously creative in the trading world. In order to allow our members to do research, and produce creative results, we will have full-time dedicated programmers. Our professionally-trained programmers will produce the work for all of our clients.</p>
<br>
<p>Working with Experts</p>
<p>We will also have experts whom members can consult, and who will be producing the latest scripts. Whether it’s Quant algorithms, Automated trading algorithms, or Artificial Intelligence (AKA AI), ie. (Deep learning); we will have the staff and tools necessary to produce results</p>
<br>
<p>Member only Trading Platform</p>
<p>We will also have a “members only” trading platform, that will give us unlimited capabilities to produce our members’ ideas of their wildest imaginations.</p>
<p>The cost of the subscription will be £50 a month. This will give you access to a large collection of Trading materials and coding services.</p>

After all many smart women and men born in the last millennia have grappled with what in the field of social science has been labeled the turn to complexity. <br></p>
<p>Other fields of science did their turn: in math we have complexity and chaos theory, in physics vast universes with barely countable particles in quantum entanglement defying determinism and leaving space for new theories, philosophy is wondering over dualisms or monoisms, the force of life, and question if it’s not better to return from the lingual to more embodied concepts. In psychology, with its many theories of the mind, seemingly rational thoughts, prove to be born of fast but not so precise automatisms, and memories a construct of constant renarration. The military strategize along VUCA concepts, and business theory is following close. <br></p>
<p>We all know of globalisation, climate change, migration, shifts in power and maybe of network effects, system theories, process and flow, power laws, the third industrial revolution, and co-evolution of (cyborg) humans and machines. Something is in flux, it does affect us, and in our eyes it is worthwhile to learn more about. <br></p>
<p>Our intention for this group is to find people who are interested in the “arrival” of awareness of complexity in everyday sensemaking. How does it affect you and me, our family and friends? Do we need to/Could we do something to provide guidance? How does the combination of thoughtful intend and the making of things (“thinkering”) can be used to understand the confusing topic? How could we use physical and digital tools for teaching, learning, experiencing, and navigating in a world of processes and flow? <br></p>
<p>We invite artists, designers, coders, scientists, writers, thinkers, tinkerers, or simply curious join us to explore the ways how our daily life looks like looking from the angle of complexity. <br></p>

<p><span>Convergence.vc is the culmination of four years’ work as a blockchain venture fund and builder having engaged with other 1,200 from around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During that time it has become clear to our team at Outlier Ventures, that blockchain is most impactful and investible at the intersections of two or more emerging technologies and applied to clear verticals like Industry 4.0 or Smart Cities and Mobility.</span></p>
<p><span>We first saw this begin to be realised where blockchains begun to be applied to and combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we started investigating, convergence opportunities were increasingly everywhere from securing 3D printing distribution networks to verifiable drone delivery networks and chatbots using blockchains to make payments on behalf of their users.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Our thesis is that blockchain technologies, including distributed ledgers &amp; smart contracts, are the infrastructure that allows all other macro-trends to converge through a common operating system and shared standards. They represent the next phase of The Web, Web 3.0 or ‘The Trust Web’, and will to transform how technologies interact with one another and the World around them.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Even more interestingly they will begin to accelerate one another leading to a cambrian explosion of innovation it will be difficult for any one business to keep pace with on their own.</b></span></p>

As this is a user group we are looking for people out there to volunteer to talk about their experiences with any JBoss.org project. If you have something that you would like to talk about then feel free to contact the organisers and ask to give a short lightning talk at the next meeting. Tell us about something you think is cool, something you think is rubbish, problems you've encountered and would like solving or problems you’ve solved and you’d like to share - anything JBoss related is what we want.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you've got any questions or need some more information about JBUG London, don't hesitate to contact one of the organisers.</p>

<p>We organise talks, meet ups, hackathons, conferences, courses and any other type of gathering that helps our community learn and share skills to write better software.</p>
<p>We curate content for our 'own' In-the-Brain Series, which feature the world's leading innovators and experts, who like to share their brain and inventions with you through their talks. In addition, we host approximately 40 meet up groups on a wide range of topics, who curate their own content and speakers, and which we support by providing our venue and by recording their talks as SkillsCasts, which are recordings of film, code and slides of every talk. We publish these SkillsCasts the next day, and they are free to watch for our members on our community website http://skillsmatter.com (and membership is free).</p>
<p><span>We also organise short conferences, which we call eXchanges, usually very specialised, aimed to give a certain idea, innovation or technology a 'push' by enabling a dedicated, passionate community to meet up, exchange ideas for projects, cooperation and learn.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we organise training courses, aimed at passionate enterprise developers, architects and project managers who want to learn new technologies and agile practices, straight from the source - our courses are authored and taught by well-known experts, often the creators of the course's subject.</p>

<p>“Nowadays we find bits of DevOps in one part of the business while other parts are using the cloud. &nbsp;How I am going to work at the&nbsp;enterprise level and not at project level anymore?”</p>
<p>Many times I don't know what to exactly reply to feature requests, process implementations, or questions about why things are done in a specific way. Most of the time the questions make a lot of sense, there is not just a way to make things in DevOps, a lot is about your taste, feeling, and ideas about how automation should be written and tools should be implemented. There are an infinite number of ways of doing things, this community is a great place to meet new people, share, discuss and learn about different ways of doing Enterprise DevOps.</p>

With a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Colorado-Boulder, April began her career in the hard disk drive industry as a process engineer designing and manufacturing recording heads. Through an acquisition, April entered the world of magnetic tape storage. Finding that recording heads were often blamed for drive problems, she switched to the other popular scapegoat for issues, the tape cartridge and media development. As her career progressed and acquisitions occurred (StorageTek to Sun Microsystems to Oracle), she gained responsibilities for the magnetic recording group and then the entire tape drive development organization.

I started this meetup group because I want to help OpenAI fulfill its mission (I’m not affiliated with the OpenAI non-profit organization). When I was in college, the world of artificial intelligence fascinated me. So I was applying Neural Nets to data sets generated by e-commerce websites (using Kohonen’s Self Organizing Maps). </p>
<p>It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today. </p>
<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in London. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.</p>
<p>If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have. Or simply say hello and introduce yourself because I would like to learn about you and the projects you are working on! See you soon!</p>

<p><b>B.U.I.L.D</b>&nbsp;(Businesses United​ ​for Innovation, Learning and Development)&nbsp;is set up to offer more opportunities for people with an entrepreneurial mindset to learn from each other and build successful businesses. Together.</p>
<p>Why join&nbsp;<b>B.U.I.L.D</b>?</p>
<p>If you are looking to participate in events like workshops, trainings, lectures, seminars, hackathons aiming to transform you and your business for success and you consider yourself a business B.U.I.L.D:er, it would be foolish of you not to join this group.</p>
<p><b>A business B.U.I.L.D:er is:</b></p>
<p>·&nbsp; anyone who wants to build a successful business;</p>
<p>·&nbsp; somebody who has an entrepreneurial mindset = often drawn to opportunities, innovation, new value creation and willing to take risks</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an employee curious about starting a business or wanting to apply entrepreneurial thinking at his/her workplace.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a smart manager or business owner looking for innovation ideas,</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an edgy consultant, freelancer or solopreneur</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a student or researcher with an entrepreneurship interest</p>
<p>Do you see value and opportunities in networking and want business dreams to come true in mutually beneficial ways? Invest in yourself and a more entrepreneurial world today and come along!</p>
<p><b>What is a B.U.I.L.D event?</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events can be about sales, marketing, branding, customer engagement, self development, finance, law, growth hacking and any other topic which in one way or another can help businesses become more awesome.</p>
<p><b>Become an event organizer</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;You can attend events and benefit from networking with likeminded. However,&nbsp;<b>your benefits can be massive if you organize these events yourself</b>. Events and Meetup groups are a great way to get:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;connections</p>
<p>•&nbsp;promote your services and expertise</p>
<p>•&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;test ideas</p>
<p>•&nbsp;feedback</p>
<p>•&nbsp;referrals&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;introductions</p>
<p>Being part of a bigger organization and group opens more doors than going about it alone. B.U.I.L.D exists in 11 cities in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running a successful Meetup-group also requires, much like a business, grit and a lot of time, dedication and effort. What if you could go in lean and test your session by organizing only one event?</p>
<p>We at B.U.I.L.D give you a chance to organize just one event (or more in the future) under the B.U.I.L.D. brand with its existing members instead of starting your own Meetup group from scratch.</p>
<p><b>How to apply</b></p>
<p>If you would like to promote your service by sharing your knowledge and expertise with other professionals and entrepreneurs with a workshop or get-together; apply to get your event published and promoted by contacting EntAnon's Community Manager Jenny via e-mail on jenny.bjorklof@entanon.com. You get support on how to organize great B.U.I.L.D events by experienced business event organizers.</p>
<p>Please note: Free events = free support, paid events = agreed profit share on a case to case basis.</p>
<p><b>The history of B.U.I.L.D</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D is a brand by EntAnon (short for Entrepreneurs Anonymous). In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>
<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;​​B.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;​ with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future ​DDM&nbsp;​meetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, ​soon ​Milano​ and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D. DDM representatives​ can&nbsp;​set up online events​ ​(webinars and conferences) and&nbsp;use the B.U.I.L.D. groups around Europe ​as ​​a channel.&nbsp;If another B.U​.​I​.​L​.​D or EntAnon​ ​event is set on the same date the organizers agree​ ​on the next best date for the&nbsp;DDM&nbsp;Alliance event to take​ ​place.</p>","EntAnon",193727111

  <strong>What is the Commons?</strong>
</p>
<p>&ldquo;The social and political space where things get done and where people have a sense of belonging and have an element of control over their lives, providing sustenance, security and independence... Commons are organized around resources that are collectively owned or shared between or among populations. These resources are said to be held in common and can include everything from natural resources to domains of the cultural sphere, e.g.: literature, music, arts, design, film, video, television, radio, information, software and sites of heritage. The commons can also include &lsquo;public goods&rsquo; such as public space, public education, health and the infrastructure that allows our society to function (such as electricity or water delivery systems). There also exists the &lsquo;life commons&rsquo;, e.g. the human genome.&rdquo; (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>
  <strong>
  <br /> Our Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>To benefit society by enhancing individual and collective competences in the protection, governance, and cultivation of commons,&nbsp;as an autonomous partner to the private and public sectors.</p>

We are a community of business professionals and technicians who meet and share ideas as a Mastermind and learn what others are doing and succeeding with in the CSP Programme in delivering Hosted Desktops (DaaS). Leading figures from the community share their stories, their victories and the ones that got away.&nbsp; The aim of the CSP User Group is to get local partners together regularly to talk about your experiences, successes, and difficulties with your clients and prospects and to use the mastermind and networking principals to be a resource for technical and business professionals who want to keep pace with the Desktop as a Service arena and related Cloud and Virtualisation technologies. We will aim to have at least one CSP partner or Citrix to present a Success Story, a War Story and updates of course on the business and market trends. We will invite technology partners to speak and include related organisations such as Microsoft, AWS, and other public cloud providers to share their stories too. With 2700 CSP partners worldwide, what matters is that you're talking about Desktop as a Service (DaaS) and related topics that are interesting and important to you. This is not a sales pitch, this is an information sharing and updating opportunity for the community to gather as they need and grow their businesses. The group will also present updates on other events organised by relevant groups, vendors and partners which can help you. We invite specialists and new technologies to present about innovative technology solutions. This group is also structured to enable participants to help each other with solution challenges if necessary. We will also drink some wine and beer and take a snack too. With already 500,000 Citrix CSP Hosted Desktops out there, this is the place to meet, learn and do more business. We are virtuosos because doing Virtual Desktops is an art!</p>
